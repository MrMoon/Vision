# Vision
Imagine taking an amazing picture, and you get home exited to put that picture on a huge monitor in your living room, so you can show it off to people who come to your house, to find out that when you put a small picture into a big screen, most of the details in the picture are lost, which leads to a blurry picture. Now that happens when you just have fun and take normal pictures, imagine when that picture is important to a crime, you can’t just get back in time to get a better looking picture with higher resolution, and we also can’t just try to guess what that blurry part of the picture is, we have to solve this problem, so we can provide better evidence to the crime.
That problem is called the Super Resolution problem, SR for short, which is essentially just taking a low resolution picture and converting it to a high resolution picture. It might seem like an easy problem to solve; because of the fact that the requirement are simple, but it’s not easy, it’s simple, but not easy, there are a lot of details that we have to care of in order to produce the same details in both the lower resolution picture and the higher resolution one, to give an example, if the lower resolution picture is a picture of a licence plate of a car, we have to make sure that we keep that license plate correct and lose some information from it.

- "Our method directly learns an end-to-end mapping between the low/high-resolution images. The mapping is represented as a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) that takes the low-resolution image as the input and outputs the high-resolution one.", [Image Super-Resolution Using Deep Convolutional Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1501.00092.pdf)

- "So the idea to solve the problem is that with sufficient training data (corresponding pairs of low and high resolution images) we can learn set of filters (i.e. a mapping) that when applied to given image that is not in the training set, will produce a higher resolution version of it, where the learning is preferably low complexity.", [RAISR: Rapid and Accurate Image, Super Resolution, Yaniv Romano, John Isidoro, and Peyman Milanfar, Fellow, IEEE](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.01299.pdf)

- "Despite the breakthroughs in accuracy and speed of single image super-resolution using faster and deeper convolutional neural networks, one central problem remains largely unsolved: how do we recover the finer texture details when we super-resolve at large upscaling factors?", [Photo-Realistic Single Image Super-Resolution Using a Generative Adversarial Network](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.04802.pdf)
